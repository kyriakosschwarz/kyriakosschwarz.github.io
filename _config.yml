  Hi, I'm Kyriakos and my passion is turning <mark>data into value</mark>.

  I bridge the gap between software engineering and drug discovery, translating complex cheminformatics data into practical, data-driven solutions. My experience involves building high-impact tools to tackle complex cheminformatics challenges, like compound selection and reaction prediction. I am a proactive and detail-oriented team player, dedicated to solving scientific problems through collaboration. As a lifelong learner, I am motivated to continuously expand my skills to advance therapeutic development.
  
  I have obtained my Ph.D. degree in <mark>Medical Artificial Intelligence</mark> from the <a href="https://www.uzh.ch/en.html">University of Zurich</a>, affiliated with the <a href="https://www.usz.ch/en/">University Hospital Zurich</a> and the <a href="https://ai.ethz.ch/">ETH AI center</a>. I am currently doing a PostDoc at ETH Zurich and Roche in Basel.

          RNA secondary structure calculation for the identification of cancer driver lncRNAs.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Computational methods that have aimed to predict cancer driver lncRNA genes have thus far relied on scores that do not specifically reflect the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_non-coding_RNA">lncRNA</a> biology. Therefore, Functional Impact scores, such as conservation scores or base pairing probabilties from RNA secondary structure can be included to improve those predictions. In this project I calculated lncRNA base pairing probabilities and correlated them with conservation scores to examine whether secondary structure is suggestive of gene function. Tools used for this project: <mark>Bash (awk, bedtools, bwtool, etc.)</mark>, <mark>Python (Snakemake)</mark>, <mark>R</mark>, <mark>RNAfold/RNAsnp</mark>

          Four molecular biology experiments for the effects of the TTL gene.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          The alpha-tubulin (α-tubulin) protein is a major structural component of microtubules which in turn are one of the three main filaments of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton. Microtubules are associated with important cellular functions, such as mitosis and meiosis, intracellular transport, cell motility, maintenance of the cell shape and others. The tubulin-tyrosine ligase (<i>TTL</i>) protein functions by ligating a tyrosine molecule at the detyrosinated C-terminal of α-tubulin. This process can have an effect on microtubule stability and subsequently on the cellular functions which are depended on the microtubule dynamics. In this work four experiments were performed which try to elucidate the consequences of engineered <i>TTL</i> genes in <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drosophila_melanogaster">Drosophila melanogaster</a></i>. The experiments include:
            - Measuring viability and fertility of Drosophila flies
            - Confocal microscopy of Drosophila ovaries
            - Western blot of tyrosinated α-tubulin
            - TTL-GFP fusion gene cloning
